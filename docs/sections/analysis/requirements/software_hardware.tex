    Keyboard and Pointing Device (eg. Mouse)             &
    For desktop or laptop computer users, a suitable input device is required in order to interact with the software.\newline
    A pointing device (a mouse) is necessary in order to interact with the user interface, to perform actions such as clicking buttons, icons, and opening menus.\newline
    A keyboard will be used to manually input data into the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\

    \textit{Tablet Device}\newline
    Touchscreen                                          & For tablet users, it would be impractical to expect the user to have access to a keyboard and or pointing device. Therefore, we must design the system to accept inputs from a touchscreen.\newline
    This will be easier to use and more intuitive for tablet users. \newline
    The touchscreen will be used to input data into the system and to interact with the user interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\

    Dual-Core Processor
    \newline(x86, ARM, RISCV architectures)              &
    A modern processor with sufficient resources to run an up-to-date web browser such as Chrome, Edge or Firefox is required in order to access the web-based interface.                                                                                                                                                           \\
    \hline
    2GB of RAM                                           & Sufficient RAM is required to run the web browser, which can be a memory intensive task.                                                                                                                                                                                 \\

    Monitor                                              & To display the user interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\
    \hline
    Network Interface Card (NIC)                         & A Network Interface Card, or NIC, is required for the computer to be connected to a network, such as the Internet. This is required as the web interface will be hosted on a domain and server that is external to the user, that is to say, not on their local network. \\
    \hline
    \textit{\textbf{Optional}: Wireless Network Adapter} & \textit{A Wireless Network Adapter is an optional requirement, it will allow the user to connect to a wireless network in order to access the network or Internet so that they can access the external user interface.}                                                  \\
    \hline
    \textit{\textbf{Optional}: Camera}                   & \textit{A Camera is an optional requirement; devices with cameras will be able to scan barcodes or QR codes corresponding to inventory items and easily perform actions on them.}                                                                                        \\
