\subparagraph{\\Overview\\}

InvenTree is an \textbf{open-source} inventory management system, providing \textit{low level stock control and part tracking}.
It uses a Python/Django database backend and provides both a \textbf{web-based interface} as well as a REST API for interacting with other services.
InvenTree also has a powerful plugin system for custom applications and other extensions. \\

\noindent Below is a screenshot of the InvenTree homepage.\\

\subparagraph{Parts applicable to my solution\\}

The core concept is similar (the application is web-based), but my solution will be more generalized that just stock control.

\subparagraph[indent=false]{\\Overview\\}

PartKeepr is an open-source inventory management system with a focus on electronic components.
It is designed around four main principles:

\begin{outline}
    \1 Fast Part Searching
    \1 Ability to add complete part database
    \1 Keeping track of stock
    \1 Ease of use
\end{outline}

\subparagraph{Parts applicable to my solution\\\\}

\noindent Like PartKeepr, I hope to implement a web-based interface.
However, I am using a different approach as my solution will not be tailored specifically to electronic components.

\subparagraph{\\Overview\\}

Sortly is a proprietary cloud-based inventory management system with a focus on small businesses and inviduals.\\\\
It has two plans available, an always free plan with limited functionality and a paid plan will a more complete feature-set.

\subparagraph{Parts applicable to my solution\\\\}

I hope to implement the following features from Sortly:

\begin{outline}
    \1 Web based interface
    \2 Allows for easy access.

    \1 Barcode support
    \2 Allows end users to print off QR codes to stick to items
    \2 Which can be scanned in-app to easily perform actions on the item.

    \1 Real-time reporting insights

    \2 Allows for added insight into usage patterns for particular units.
